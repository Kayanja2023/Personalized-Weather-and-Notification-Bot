# Weather Notification Bot

Overview

The Personalized Weather and Notification Bot is a multi-functional application designed to provide users with real-time weather updates and custom notifications. It integrates seamlessly with external APIs to fetch weather data and deliver personalized notifications via preferred communication channels.

This project is structured to utilize both Python and Node.js for robust and scalable development.
# Features

- Real-time Weather Updates: Retrieves current weather conditions and forecasts for specified locations.

- Custom Notifications: Sends personalized alerts based on user-defined triggers (e.g., severe weather conditions).

- Multi-Platform Support: Delivers notifications via email, SMS, or messaging apps.

- Extensibility: Modular design allows easy integration with additional APIs and services.

# Tech Stack

## Backend
- **Python**: Used for weather data processing and API integration.
- **Node.js**: Handles notification delivery and real-time communication.

## Frameworks and Libraries
- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for API development.
- **Bolt.js**: A Node.js framework for building Slack apps.

## APIs
- **OpenWeatherMap**: Provides weather data for processing and notifications.
- **Twilio**: Enables SMS notifications to users.
- **Slack API**: Facilitates integration with the Slack messaging platform.

## Database
- **SQLite**: Used for storing user data and preferences.

## Testing
- **Pytest**: Python testing framework for unit and integration testing.
